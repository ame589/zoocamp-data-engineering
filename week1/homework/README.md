- The file [upload-data-green-taxi.ipynb](upload-data-green-taxi.ipynb) is a jupyter script responsible to ingest green taxi data downloaded from https://github.com/DataTalksClub/nyc-tlc-data/releases/download/green/green_tripdata_2019-01.csv.gz into a local Postgres instance.
- The file [upload-data-zones.ipynb](upload-data-zones.ipynb) is a jupyter script responsible to ingest zones data downloaded from https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv into a local Postgres instance.

FROM green_taxi_data
ORDER BY trip_distance DESC
LIMIT 1;
```
## Query n.5

``` sql
SELECT count(*), '2_PASSENGERS'
FROM green_taxi_data
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime::date = date '2019-01-01' AND passenger_count = 2
UNION ALL
SELECT count(*), '3_PASSENGERS'
FROM green_taxi_data
WHERE lpep_pickup_datetime::date = date '2019-01-01' AND passenger_count = 3;
```
## Query n.6

``` sql
SELECT "Zone"
FROM taxi_zone
WHERE "LocationID" = 
(
    SELECT t."DOLocationID"
    FROM green_taxi_data t
    JOIN taxi_zone tz
        ON t."PULocationID" = tz."LocationID"
    WHERE tz."Zone" = 'Astoria'
    ORDER BY t."tip_amount" DESC
    LIMIT 1
);
